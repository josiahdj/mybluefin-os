Modifying SELinux policies on Bluefin Linux requires a different approach than on traditional Linux distributions due to its atomic and immutable design. You cannot simply change files in  and expect them to persist. Instead, you must build a custom image that includes your policy changes. [1, 2]  
Here is a general workflow for creating a custom SELinux policy on Bluefin: 
1. Create a custom image with BlueBuild 
Bluefin is part of the Universal Blue project, which uses  images that are built with a tool called . You will need to create your own  repository to customize the image. This allows you to add or modify packages and configurations, including SELinux policies. 

• Fork the template repository: Start by forking a template BlueBuild repository from Universal Blue, such as . 
• Clone your fork: Clone your new repository to your local machine to begin making changes. 

2. Define your SELinux policies 
Your custom SELinux policy is defined using a set of files that describe the rules and contexts. 

•  (Type Enforcement) file: This file defines the policy rules, including new types and domains. 
•  (File Context) file: This file contains the instructions for labeling files associated with your application. 
•  (Interface) file: This file contains macros that allow other policy modules to interact with your custom policy. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

3. Integrate your policies into the custom image 
Once you have your policy files, you need to integrate them into your custom BlueBuild image. 

• Copy files: Place your , , and  files into an appropriate directory within your BlueBuild repository. The  build process will need to know where to find these. 
• Add build instructions: Modify your  or a related file in the BlueBuild project to include commands for installing and compiling your policy. This would typically involve: 

	• Installing : Ensure the build environment has the necessary tools to compile SELinux policies. 
	• Compiling and installing the policy: Use commands like  and  to compile your policy module and install it. 

4. Build and rebase to your custom image 
After committing your changes to your BlueBuild repository, a GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build your new image. 

• Monitor the build: Watch the GitHub Actions page for your repository to ensure the build completes successfully. 
• Rebase your system: Once the image is available, rebase your Bluefin installation to your custom image using the  command. 
• Reboot: After the rebase is complete, reboot your system to apply the new image with the custom SELinux policy. [9, 10]  

Example SELinux modifications 
For reference, the Universal Blue Discourse has documented workarounds and examples of how SELinux is handled for specific applications. These often involve  
 oneshot services to handle labeling issues, which can provide insight into how to approach your own modifications. 
Important: Customizing SELinux is an advanced topic. Making mistakes can prevent your system from booting or cause applications to fail. Always test your custom images thoroughly before using them for critical tasks. [13]
